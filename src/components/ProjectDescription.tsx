        This project aims to provide a device targeted towards drone, robot and remote-operated vehicle (ROV) operators with the aim of simplifying initial configuration of devices before deployment of the drone / robot / ROV.
        Construction and development of this device is an exploration of a specialized use-case computing platform rarely seen in the consumer electronics sector.
        <br /><br />
        An overarching theme within this development effort is the return to aspects of older, vintage technology.
        <br /><br />
        In a world of endless information, artificial intelligence, touchscreens and software updates, I believe that there is profound value in taking a step back and studying technology from the past. In this pursuit I have discovered that physical control surfaces such as real switches, sliders and rotary dials are much more appealing to interact with compared to pressing a virtual button on a GUI and that analog-format video still has a place in todayâ€™s world. This project aims to strike a balance between the old and the new world in respect to user interaction and potentially convince individuals that more touchscreens are not always the answer.
